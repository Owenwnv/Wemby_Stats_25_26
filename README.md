# NBA Performance Analysis: Victor Wembanyama 2025/26

### This project is a statistical analysis pipeline, implemented in Python, designed to evaluate the initial season performance of NBA player Victor Wembanyama using actual game data. The goal is to calculate advanced performance metrics (DD, TD, 5x5), and visualize key trends.

# Technologies Used

### This project relies entirely on core Python libraries and standard Data Science tools:

### - Pandas: Used extensively for data cleaning, manipulation, and calculating aggregated metrics (averages, Double-Doubles, Triple-Doubles, 5x5).

### - Matplotlib / Seaborn: Used for generating all three data visualizations, including line charts for trends, bar charts for performance comparisons, and customized clustered bar plots for conditional analysis.
